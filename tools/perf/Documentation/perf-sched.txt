NAME
----
perf-sched - Tool to trace/measure scheduler properties (latencies)

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'perf sched' {record|latency|map|replay|script|timehist}

DESCRIPTION
-----------
There are several variants of perf sched:

  'perf sched record <command>' to record the scheduling events
  of an arbitrary workload.

  'perf sched latency' to report the per task scheduling latencies
  and other scheduling properties of the workload.

  'perf sched script' to see a detailed trace of the workload that
   was recorded (aliased to 'perf script' for now).

  'perf sched replay' to simulate the workload that was recorded
  via perf sched record. (this is done by starting up mockup threads
  that mimic the workload based on the events in the trace. These
  threads can then replay the timings (CPU runtime and sleep patterns)
  of the workload as it occurred when it was recorded - and can repeat
  it a number of times, measuring its performance.)

  'perf sched map' to print a textual context-switching outline of
  workload captured via perf sched record.  Columns stand for
  individual CPUs, and the two-letter shortcuts stand for tasks that
  are running on a CPU. A '*' denotes the CPU that had the event, and
  a dot signals an idle CPU.

  'perf sched timehist' to show context-switching analysis with times
  between schedule-in, schedule delay, and run time. If callchains are
  present stack trace is dumped at the end of the line. A summary of
  run times can be shown as well.

OPTIONS
-------
-i::
--input=<file>::
        Input file name. (default: perf.data unless stdin is a fifo)

-v::
--verbose::
        Be more verbose. (show symbol address, etc)

-D::
--dump-raw-trace=::
        Display verbose dump of the sched data.

OPTIONS for 'perf sched map'
----------------------------

--compact::
	Show only CPUs with activity. Helps visualizing on high core
	count systems.

--cpus::
	Show just entries with activities for the given CPUs.

--color-cpus::
	Highlight the given cpus.

--color-pids::
	Highlight the given pids.

OPTIONS for 'perf sched timehist'
---------------------------------
-k::
--vmlinux=<file>::
    vmlinux pathname

--kallsyms=<file>::
    kallsyms pathname

-s::
--summary::
    Show only a summary of scheduling by thread with min, max, and average
    run times (in sec) and relative stddev.

-S::
--with-summary::
    Show all scheduling events followed by a summary by thread with min,
    max, and average run times (in sec) and relative stddev.

-w::
--wakeups::
    Show wakeup events.

--call-graph::
        Display call chains. Default is on. Use --no-call-graph to suppress

--max-stack::
    Set the stack depth limit when showing the callchains. Default: 5

--symfs=<directory>::
    Look for files with symbols relative to this directory.

-V::
--cpu-visual::
    Add a visual that better emphasizes activity by cpu. Idle times
    are denoted with 'i'; schedule events with an 's'.
